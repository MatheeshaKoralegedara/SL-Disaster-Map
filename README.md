# SL-Disaster-Map
The Interactive Flood Map is a real-time digital platform designed to help Sri Lankans track flood-affected areas following Cyclone Dithwa. It displays live updates on flooded zones, roadblocks, landslide risks, safe routes, and emergency facilities, enabling citizens, rescue teams, and authorities to navigate safely and make informed decisions.
